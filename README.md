# Predicting Hurricane Trajectories Using an RNN

In this project, we use a recurrent neural network to predict the trajectory paths of hurricanes. We use the Hurricane Database dataset from [Unisys Weather](http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/). Here we will preprocess the data, then train a recurrent neural network on some of the samples, and compare our predictions against the real hurricanes. So far, we're using only the years 2000 to 2009 and is saved on our repo as '2000-2009-data.csv'. 

## Getting Started

The code was written and run in a Jupyter notebook. For local installation, make sure you have [pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run: 

```
$ pip install notebook
```
Then to run, you would launch the notebook with:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Running 

The project successfully trains a model, however graphing the trajectories and latitude and longitude points needs work. That is under construction.
