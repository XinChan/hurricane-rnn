# Predicting Hurricane Trajectories Using an RNN

In this project, we'll be using neural networks to predict the trajectory paths of hurricanes in South Florida. We will be using the Hurricane Database dataset from Unisys Weather. Here we will preprocess the data, then train a recurrent neural network on some of the samples. At the end, we'll get to see our neural network's hurricane trajectory path predictions. So far, we're using only the years 2000 to 2009 and is saved on our repo as '2000-2009-data.csv'. We have to get an idea of the hurricanes' behavior to properly create a model for our neural network.

## Getting Started

The code was written and run in a Jupyter notebook. For local installation, make sure you have [pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run: 

```
$ pip install notebook
```
Then to run, you would launch the notebook with:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Running 

The project successfully trains a model, however graphing the trajectories and latitude and longitude points needs work. That is unconstruction.
